<h1 style="color:darkgreen";"> How to make Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam: </h1> 
<h2 style=
<p style= "color:black";"> Put a whole can (14 oz) of condensed milk in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, along with a cup of pumpkin puree, 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, and Â¼ tsp salt. <br> Since the milk is sweetened, you don't need to add any more sugar to the mixture. <br> Stir together and heat for about 5 minutes, until it's just starting to bubble. <br> Remove it from the heat and stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. <br> Pour the pumpkin spice sauce into a heat-proof jar or bowl (I like to use a large mason jar) and place in the fridge to cool. </p>
