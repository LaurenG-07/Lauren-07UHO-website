<h1 style="color:darkgreen";"> How to make Pumpkin Cream Cold Foam: </h1> 
<h2 style="color:black";"> You can make the pumpkin cold cream in advance and then turn it into a cold foam right before you're ready to enjoy your drink.
<p style= "color:black";"> To make the cold cream, simply put ¾ cup 2% milk, ¼ cup heavy cream, 2 ½ tablespoons pumpkin spice sauce, and 2 teaspoons vanilla syrup in a large jar and shake really well to combine. <br> If you don't have a large jar, you can stir all the ingredients together in a bowl and then transfer to an airtight container. <br> This is your pumpkin cold cream! If you're not using it right away, keep it in an airtight container in the fridge.
